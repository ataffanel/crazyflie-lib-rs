# Crazyflie rust lib

Rust crate to connect and control a Crazyflie.
This repos is very much work-in-progess, nothing is expected to work yet.
Examples will be added regularly to exercise progress.

The goal is to make a crate to allow control of a Crazyflie from rust.
One of the main short-term goal is to make a Wasm binding so that a web-client could be easily implemented for the Crazyflie.
Other bindings for CPP, Python or even ROS might be interesting in the future.
